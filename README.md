# CAsteroids
Asteroids made with a custom C doubly linked list library
You can use the linkedlist.h header in any file you want to have generic linked list functionality.
To compile this, download SDL3 from the official website and put the files in the include and lib folders as stated in the 'run.bat' file.
You should be able to run the game with the executable, provided the SDL3.dll file is in the same directory.
